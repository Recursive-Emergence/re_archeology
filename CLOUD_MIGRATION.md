# Cloud Migration: PostgreSQL to Neo4j

## Current Status
- ✅ Successfully migrated from PostgreSQL to Neo4j locally
- ✅ Removed all SQLAlchemy dependencies
- ✅ Neo4j-based API endpoints working
- ✅ Frontend updated for Neo4j API

## Cloud Migration Steps

### 1. Stop PostgreSQL Cloud Instance
Your current PostgreSQL instance: `34.59.159.217:5432`

**Action Required:** Stop/delete this instance to save costs since we no longer need it.

### 2. Set Up Neo4j Aura (Recommended)

#### Steps:
1. Go to https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new AuraDB Free instance
4. Save the connection details (URI, username, password)

#### Benefits:
- Free tier: 200k nodes, 400k relationships
- Managed service with automatic backups
- SSL/TLS encryption included
- Perfect for MVP development

### 3. Alternative: Google Cloud Neo4j

If you prefer to stay within Google Cloud ecosystem:

```bash
# Deploy Neo4j on Google Cloud using Cloud Marketplace
# Or use Google Cloud VM with Neo4j Community Edition
```

### 4. Update Environment Configuration

Once you have your Neo4j Aura connection details, update:

```bash
# Production .env
NEO4J_URI=neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io
NEO4J_USER=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-aura-password
```

### 5. Deploy to Google Cloud Run

Update docker-compose.yml for production:
- Remove local Neo4j service
- Use cloud Neo4j URI
- Keep Redis or use Cloud Memory Store

## Cost Comparison

### Before (PostgreSQL):
- PostgreSQL Cloud SQL: ~$25-50/month
- Storage: ~$10/month

### After (Neo4j Aura Free):
- Neo4j Aura Free: $0/month
- Savings: ~$35-60/month

## Next Steps
1. Create Neo4j Aura account
2. Get connection credentials
3. Test connection
4. Update production environment
5. Deploy to Cloud Run
